### 1. Vessel Verse

Vessel Verse is a large-scale dataset for brain vessel annotation. It gathers 1,130 annotated images from three public datasets, covering different neurovascular imaging modalities.

### 2. Collaborative Framework

In addition to the dataset, Vessel Verse introduces a novel framework that allows for multi-expert annotations and refinements. Its key components include version control, consensus generation, and a user-friendly interface.

### 3. Multi-expert Annotations

The framework supports multiple annotation protocols, enabling users to select the annotation style that best fits their needs.

### 4. Consensus Generation

Vessel Verse offers a STAPLE-based consensus mechanism, allowing users to combine annotations from different experts or algorithms.

### 5. Version Control

To ensure annotation quality and traceability, Vessel Verse implements version control. It tracks annotation changes and allows for expert review and correction.
