### 1. 1. Introduction
The excellent soft tissue contrast and ﬂexibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) makes it a very powerful diagnostic tool for a wide range of disorders, including neurological, musculoskeletal, and oncological diseases. However, the long acquisition time in MRI, which can easily exceed 30 minutes, leads to low patient throughput, problems with patient comfort and compliance, artifacts from patient motion, and high exam costs. As a consequence, increasing imaging speed has been a major ongoing research goal since the advent of MRI in the 1970s. Increases in imaging speed have been achieved through both hardware developments (such as improved magnetic ﬁeld gradients) and software advances (such as new pulse sequences). One noteworthy development in this context is parallel imaging, introduced in the 1990s, which allows multiple data points to be sampled simultaneously, rather than in a traditional sequential order . The introduction of compressed sensing (CS) in 2006 promised another breakthrough in the reduction of MR scan time. At their core, CS techniques speed up the MR acquisition by acquiring less measurement data than has previously been required to reconstruct diagnostic quality images. Since undersampling of this kind violates the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, aliasing artifacts are introduced which must be eliminated in the course of image reconstruction.

## 2. Background The excellent soft tissue contrast and ﬂxibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRA) makes it a very powerful diagnostic tool for diseases such as neurovascular diseases, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, the long acquisition time in MRA, which can easily exceed 30 minutes (see, e.g., ), leads to low patient throughput, problems with artifacts from patient motion, and high exam cost. As a consequence, increasing imaging speed is a major ongoing research goal since the advent of MR in the 1970s. increases in imaging speed have been achieved through both hard- ware developments (such as improved magnetic ﬁeld gradient ﬁeld gradients) and software advances(such as new pulse sequences). One noteworty development in this context is parallel imaging , introduced in the 1990s , which allows multiple data points to be sampled concurrently, rather than in a traditional sequential order. The introduction of compressed sensing (CS), in 2006 , promised another breakthrough in the reduction of MRscan time. At their core, CS techniques speedup the MR acquisition by acquiring less measurement datathan has previously been required to reconstruct diagnostic qualityimages.

This section explains the core idea in simple terms, focusing on why it matters and how it is used. We briefly situate the problem in medical imaging and clarify what the dataset/framework adds. Key design choices are sketched without equations, emphasizing intuition and constraints. We highlight trade‑offs and connect this part to the next section.
