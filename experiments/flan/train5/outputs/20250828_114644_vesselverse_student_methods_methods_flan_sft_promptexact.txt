VesselVerse is the largest release of brain vessel annotations to date, comprising three publicly available datasets totaling 1,130 annotated images from various neurovascular imaging modalities. The dataset is supported by a methodological framework for managing and improving vessel annotations over time quality through a combination of automated methods and expert-validated annotations. Figure 2 presents an overview of the framework, which consists of three components: (1) Expert annotations, (2) a STAPLE-based consensus mechanism that allows for combined multiple expert annotations and refinements, and (3) a version control system for tracking annotation evolution. Expert Annotations. Vessel Verse manages multiple experts for a single image, allowing for various annotation protocols within the same dataset. For instance, annotation protocols may vary in several aspects, including the criteria for establishing vessel contours (e.g., specific windowing-level values to set for visualization during annotation, inclusion/exclusion of vessels).
