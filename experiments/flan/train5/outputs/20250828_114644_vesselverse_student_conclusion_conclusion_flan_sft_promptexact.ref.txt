healthy patients, acquired at the University of North Carolina using a 3T Siemens Allegra scanner. Only the MRA sequence is considered. TopCoW containing 215 Computed Tomography angiographies (CTA) and MRA pairs from the University Hospital Zurich (i.e. 430 images in total).

 The expert annotations. For each image of the VesselVerse collection, up to 9 expert annotations are available. Along with assisted manual annotations (MA) by an expert annotator, we include labels using a Frangi filter (FF) (15 equally spaced scales with min 0 2 max 2 0 In addition, 6 models were trained to generate expert annotations. The considered models are: 1) nnU- Net and A2V , which correspond to the only methods of the TopCoW 2023 challenge capable of handling both MRA and CTA with a single model; 3) SPOCKMIP (S-MIP) , 4) VesselBoost (VB) and 5) JOB-VS pre-trained models available from the SMILE-UHURA challenge that were publicly available; and 6) StochasticBatchAL (SB-AL) an active learning model that iteratively refines segmentation outputs through stochastic selection. For the MRA images, models are trained using 22 manually annotated images from IXI dataset. For the CTA images, manual annotations obtained after correcting labels generated using the Frangi filter were used for training a nnU-Net and fine-tuning an A2V.

 Lastly, for reproducibility, we provide the STAPLE-based consensus annotation (CA) used for validation (Sec. 4). Nonetheless, we highlight that consensus annotations can always be generated through the frameworkâ€™s tools. Table 2 summarizes the contents of the VesselVerse dataset.
