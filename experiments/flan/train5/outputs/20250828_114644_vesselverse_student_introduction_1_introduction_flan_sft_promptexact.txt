The authors conducted a thorough evaluation of existing state-of-the-art 3D brain vessel segmentation models to assess their ability to accurately delineate the brain’s vasculature. The authors performed extensive evaluations of the model’s performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to determine whether it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and usability. The authors also performed a detailed evaluation of the system’s safety profile, including its ability to detect abnormalities in the image and its ability to mitigate adverse effects. The authors acknowledge that there is a need for more rigorous evaluations of 3D brain vessels segmentation models, particularly for complex anatomical structures.
