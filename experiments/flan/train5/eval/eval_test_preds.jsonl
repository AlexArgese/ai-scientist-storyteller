{"prediction": "Tacotron 2 is a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.", "reference": "Generation of linguistic features (phonemes, duration) that are extracted from the text. Generation of features that represent corresponding extracted speech signals (cepstrum, frequency, linear spectrogram, Mel spectrogram).\nDeep neural networks are powerful tools that can approximate an arbitrarily complex function – bring some space of input data X into output space Y. In the context of our task, X and Y will be text and audio recordings with speech, respectively.\nWe chose the LJSpeech dataset as a training data set, which contains 13’100 audio tracks, 2-10 seconds each, and a text file corresponding to each record (aka lyrics). Based on the above-mentioned transformations, the sound is encoded into the Mel-spectrogram. The text is then tokenized and turned into a sequence of integers. Additionally we normalized all texts, transcribed all numbers into words (“5” —> “five”), and decoded abbreviations (“Mrs. Robinson” —> “Misses Robinson”). So, after preprocessing, we received sets of arrays of numerical sequences and Mel-spectrograms recorded as .npy files.\nIn order to match all the dimensions in the tensor batches at the learning stage, we’ve added paddings to short sequences. For sequences in text format, 0 was reserved for padding, and for spectrograms, frames, the values of which were slightly lower than the minimum value of the spectrograms defined by us. This is recommended for separating these paddings from noise and silence.\nThe decoder output from each step will be the predicted spectrogram. However, this is not the end. To improve the spectrogram quality, it is passed through the PostNet module, which is a stack of 5 one-dimensional convolutional layers with 512 filters in each and a filter size of 5. Each layer (except the last) is followed by batch-normalization and tangent activation. To return to the spectrogram dimension, we skip the output of the PostNet through a fully-connected layer with 80 neurons and add the obtained data to the initial result of the decoder. We then receive the Mel-spectrogram generated from the text.\nWhile working with seq2seq-models you will face the problem of different lengths of sequences in the batch. It is simply solved by adding paddings – reserved characters (in case of encoder input data), or frames with specific values (in case of a decoder). However, you should properly apply the error function to the predicted and real spectrograms. We used a mask in the error function for reading the errors excluding paddings."}
{"prediction": "In this paper, we describe a unified, entirely neural approach to speech synthesis that combines the best of the previous approaches: a sequence-to-sequence Tacotron-style model that generates mel spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet vocoder. Trained directly on normalized character sequences and corresponding speech waveforms, our model learns to synthesize natural sounding speech that is difficult to distinguish from real human speech. Deep Voice 3 [11] describes a similar approach, but unlike our system, its naturalness has not been shown to rival that of human speech. Char2Wav [16] describes yet another similar approach to end-to-end TTS using a neural vocoder. However, unlike our system, its naturalness has not been shown to rival that of human speech.", "reference": "Conventional Text-to-Speech Approaches\nThe task of computer speech synthesis has long been the focus of scientists and engineers. However, classic approaches do not synthesize speech indistinguishable from that of a human. That is why, here, as in many other areas, deep learning has come to the rescue.\nThis method is based on the pre-recording of short audio sequences, which are then combined to create coherent speech. It turns out very clean and clear but is absolutely devoid of emotion and tone components, so it sounds unnatural. This happens because it is impossible to get an audio recording of all possible words uttered in all possible combinations of emotions and prosody.\nThe use of the concatenated TTS method is limited due to a large amount of data and enormous development time required. Therefore, a statistical parametric speech synthesis method, which explores the very nature of the data, was developed. It generates speech by combining certain parameters such as frequency, amplitude spectrum, etc.\nParametric synthesis consists of two stages:\nThese manually-configured parameters, along with linguistic features, are transmitted to the vocoder model, which performs many complex transformations to generate a sound wave. In this case, the vocoder evaluates speech parameters such as phase, prosody, tone, and others.\nIf we can approximate the parameters that define speech on each of its samples, then we can create a parametric model. Parametric synthesis requires less data and effort than concatenative systems.\nTheoretically, parametric synthesis is simple, but in practice, there are many artifacts that lead to the production of muffled speech with a buzzing sidetone, which sounds unnatural. This is happening because at each stage of the synthesis, we encode some features to achieve a realistic speech production. However, the selected data is based on our understanding of the speech, and in fact, human knowledge is not entirely comprehensive so the selected features will not necessarily be the best fit for any situation. Here is where deep learning takes the stage.\nF is a convolution operation,"}

Let’s consider the architecture of the feature prediction net, which we will call Tacotron 2, named after the central element of the entire synthesis system.\nTacotron 2 Architecture Explained\nTacotron 2 is not one network, but two: Feature prediction net and NN-vocoder WaveNet. Feature prediction net is considered as the main network, while the WaveNet vocoder plays the role of a supplemental system.\nTacotron2 has sequence to sequence architecture. It consists of an encoder, which creates internal representation of the input signal (symbolic tokens), and a decoder, which turns this representation into a Mel-spectrogram. A very important element of the network is the PostNet, designed to improve the spectrogram generated by the decoder.\nSome of the modules use information from the previous step of the decoder. But on the first step, the information will be zero-value tensors, which is a common approach in creating recurrent structures.\nThe Workflow with Tacontron 2\nThe output of PreNet in concatenation with the context vector, obtained as a result of the attention mechanism, is directed to the entrance of the unidirectional two-layer LSTM network with 1024 neurons in each layer.\nVisualization of Tacotron 2 Processing\nHowever, after all the modules started working properly, something like this is displayed:\nWe have accumulated some thoughts on the development process with text to speech synthesis so far. Some of them are common, others are more specific and unique. Here are our tips for those who consider Tacotron 2 as a text-to-speech solution for their projects.\nGeneral Tips on the Workflow with Tacontron 2:\nIn Tacontron 2 and similar architectures, you should follow the principles of encapsulation: 1 class equals 1 Python-module. This approach is rarely found in ML tasks but helps to structure the code, speed up debugging, and the development process.\nBuilding and Training of Text-to-Speech Models Based on Tacontron 2 Architecture:\nThank you for reading until the very end.

{"prediction": "Google has announced Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.", "reference": "WaveNet produced what I called “eerily convincing” speech one audio sample at a time, which probably sounds like overkill to anyone who knows anything about sound design. But while it is effective, WaveNet requires a great deal of metadata about language to start out: pronunciation, known linguistic features, etc. Tacotron synthesized more high-level features, such as intonation and prosody, but wasn’t really suited for producing a final speech product.\nTacotron 2 uses pieces of both, though I will frankly admit that at this point we have reached the limits of my technical expertise, such as it is. But from what I can tell, it uses text and narration of that text to calculate all the linguistic rules that systems normally have to be explicitly told. The text itself is converted into a Tacotron-style “mel-scale spectrogram” for purposes of rhythm and emphasis, while the words themselves are generated using a WaveNet-style system.\nLastly, there is no way to control the tone of speech — for example upbeat or concerned — although accents and other subtleties can be baked in as they could be with WaveNet.\nLowering the barrier for training a system means more and better ones can be trained, and new approaches integrated without having to re-evaluate a complex manually defined ruleset or source new such rulesets for new languages or speech styles."}

{"prediction": "Google has unveiled Tacotron, a machine learning model that can generate audio in real-time. Tacotron is based on a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network with attention which predicts a sequence of mel-frequency spectrogram frames from an input character sequence, and a modified version of WaveNet which generates time-domain waveform samples conditioned on the predicted mel spectrogram frames. A mel-frequency spectrogram is related to the linear-frequency spectrogram, i.e., the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) magnitude. It is obtained by applying a nonlinear transform to the frequency axis of the STFT, inspired by measured responses from the human auditory system, and summarizes the frequency content with fewer dimensions. Using such an auditory frequency scale has the effect of emphasizing details in lower frequencies, which are critical to speech intelligibility, while de-emphasizing high frequencies, which are dominated by fricatives and other noise bursts and generally do not need to be modeled with high fidelity. Because of these properties, features derived from the mel scale have been used as an underlying representation for speech recognition for many decades [17]. While linear spectrograms discard phase information (and are therefore lossy), algorithms such as Griffin-Lim [14] are capable of estimating this discarded information, which enables time-domain conversion via the inverse short-time Fourier transform. Mel spectrograms discard even more information, presenting a challenging inverse problem.

{"prediction": "Tacotron 2 is a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.", "reference": "Text To Speech With Tacotron 2: Stephen William 3 min read · Nov 9, 2021 -- Listen Share\n\nA Brief Summary\n\n“The original study can be found at arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf”\n\nAs text to speech becomes more and more popular and more ingrained to our everyday life I thought it would be a good idea to go over a Text to Speech architecture called Tacotron 2.\n\nText to Speech (TTS) which is also sometimes called Speech synthesis, is technology that enables text to be converted into speech sounds imitative of the human voice.\n\nTacotron 2 is a neural network architecture for text to speech that uses a\n\nrecurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction that maps the text character embeddings to the mel-scale spectrograms. To sum that down Tacotron takes text as an input and uses Natural Language Processing tools to convert it to character embedded sequences and then thrown into a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature that predicts a sequence of mel spectrum frames. The mel spectrum is a visual way of looking at audio data in a time-frequency domain with the bins representing pitch classes. The model also generates a time-domain waveform that is taken from the mel spectrum using a modified version of an architecture known as WaveNet. This is achieved by doing a inverse Fourier Transform which is a function that transforms data from the time-frequence domain to the time-power domain. Having the 2 different acoustic representations allows us to train the two separately.\n\nIn Tacotron the mel spectrograms are computed through a short-time Fourier transform using a 50ms frame size and a Hann window function. The Hann window function is a smoothing technique that averages the frequencies to produce and visualize a smoother and more bearable waveform. The audio data is scaled to a range between 125 Hz to 7.6 kHz which is the range of the human voice and a Log compression is also put in place to limit the dynamic range or how loud and quiet the audio data can be. This filtering will make it easier for the network to analyze and predict the audio as well as save processing power. The 2 acoustic representations are then fed into a neural network that is composed of an encoder and a decoder.\n\nThe encoder converts a character sequence into a hidden feature representation and the decoder takes that to predict a spectrogram while the decoder in an autoregressive recurrent neural network which predicts a mel spectrogram from the encoded input sequence one frame at a time.\n\nA modified version of the WaveNet architecture is used to invert the mel spectrogram feature representation into time-domain samples. The WaveNet output is used to predict the parameters for the training process. The training process starts with training the feature prediction network on its own followed by training a modified WaveNet that is separate from the first WaveNet made and is training on the predicted feature prediction network. This aligns the waveforms in a coherent and linear matter.\n\nThe network cycles thru the waveforms and saves the ones that line up with the ground truth frame until all the input text character embeddings have been used. This output synthesizes a vocoder that mimics the human voice."}

Trained directly on normalized character sequences and corresponding speech waveforms, our model learns to synthesize natural sounding speech that is difficult to distinguish from real human speech. Deep Voice 3 [11] describes a similar approach, but unlike our system, its naturalness has not been shown to rival that of human speech.

The concatenation of the LSTM output and the attention context vector is projected through a linear transform to predict the target spectrogram frame.

Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features.

The encoder converts a character sequence into a hidden feature representation, which serves as input to the decoder to predict a spectrogram. Input text (yellow) is presented using a learnt 512-dimensional character embedding, which are passed through a stack of three convolutional layers (each containing 512 filters with shape 5 × 1), followed by batch normalization and ReLU activations.

WaveGlow combines insights from Glow5 and WaveNet6 in order to provide fast, efficient and high-quality audio synthesis, without the need for auto-regression.

The Tacotron 2 model was trained on the LJ Speech dataset with audio samples no longer than 10 seconds, which corresponds to about 860 mel spectrograms. Therefore the inference is expected to work well with generating audio samples of similar length. We set the mel spectrogram length limit to 2,000 (about 23 seconds), since in practice it still produces the correct voice.

Specifically, we train a neural codec language model (called VALL-E) using discrete codes derived from an off-the-shelf neural audio codec model, and regard TTS as a conditional language modeling task rather than continuous signal regression as in previous work. VALL-E emerges in-context learning capabilities and can be used to synthesize high-quality personalized speech with only a 3-second enrolled recording of an unseen speaker as a prompt. VALL-E significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS system in terms of speech naturalness and speaker similarity. In addition, VALL-E could preserve the speaker’s emotion and acoustic environment of the acoustic prompt in synthesis. Extending its capabilities, VALL-E X adapts to multi-lingual scenarios, facilitating cross-lingual zero-shot TTS. Meanwhile, VALL-E R introduces a phoneme monotonic alignment strategy, bolstering the robustness of speech generation. With the integration of repetition-aware sampling and grouped code modeling techniques, VALL-E 2 achieves a groundbreaking milestone: human parity in zero-shot TTS performance on LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets. This marks the first instance of such an achievement, setting a new standard for the field. MELLE is a novel continuous-valued tokens based language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which are originally designed for audio compression and sacrifice fidelity compared to mel-spectrograms. FELLE effectively predicts continuous-valued tokens (mel-spectrograms), by leveraging the autoregressive nature of language models and the generative efficacy of flow matching. PALLE combines explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, and generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps, followed with a second stage, in which low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel leveraging the global contextual information."}

Furthermore, the human evaluation shows that our VALL-E X outperforms strong baselines in terms of SMOS (4.00 vs. 3.42 in XTTS, 4.12 vs. 3.06 in S2ST), CMOS (+0.24 for ours vs. baseline in XTTS), and MOS (3.87 vs. 3.81 in S2ST).", "reference": "Not so long ago, text-to-speech (TTS) outputs were disappointingly deadpan and robotic.

By training on large-scale multi-lingual multi-speaker speech-transcription data, the proposed VALL-E X demonstrates strong in-context learning capabilities and can support zero-shot cross-lingual text-to-speech and zero-shot voice-retentive speech-to-speech translation tasks. For future work, we plan to expand this method with more data and more languages.", "reference": "We develop a cross-lingual neural codec language model VALL-E X with large multilingual multi-speaker multi-domain unclean speech data.\nThe multilingual in-context learning framework enables VALL-E X to generate cross-lingual speech maintaining the unseen speaker’s voice, emotion, and speech background, prompted by only one sentence in the source language.\nWe apply VALL-E X to zero-shot cross-lingual text-to-speech synthesis and zero-shot speech-to-speech translation tasks. Experiments show that the proposed VALL-E X can beat strong baselines in terms of speaker similarity, speech quality, translation quality, speech naturalness, and human evaluation.\nAudio samples are here, and the code is available on the project’s GitHub.

Full results will be presented before thousands of doctors at the opening of the convention Saturday morning. STAT was given a press release in advance containing some data from the study, which was shared with the researchers who commented for this story.\nadvertisement\nNewsletters Sign up for ACC in 30 Seconds Your guide to what's happening at the 2019 ACC meeting in New Orleans.

I am not one of those cardiologists that are blaming Apple for giving us too much information,” said Dr. Rajat Deo, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. It’s doctors’ job, he said, to figure out how to use this information. He said that 84 percent rate was low enough to be “concerning,” but he expects it to improve over time. The study, therefore, represents a promise of what might be — but it is not yet a device doctors should trust on its own.\n“We are not talking about a medical-grade technology, we’re talking about a fun technology we go running with to check our heart rate,” Deo said. “I would caution clinicians not to act based on Apple Watch data alone.”\nThat mix of hope and skepticism was generally the reaction of doctors given a preview of the data. Some were harsher: Dr. Steven Nissen, the chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, worried that the data are still “unpublished, unverified, unreviewed, and not tested by peers.”\nSu said he’s seen about a hundred patients who have come to him after getting a scary result from the Apple Watch, but he doesn’t remember any of them needing a major intervention. He could foresee using the watch to track some patients who have received treatment for atrial fibrillation.\nBut for many experts, the study isn’t really about whether the Apple Watch can have an impact on public health now. It’s about embarking on an entirely new way of doing clinical research and practicing medicine someday.\nDr. Jordan Safirstein, an interventional cardiologist at Morristown Medical Center, said the result was “amazing,” not because of the results, but because researchers were able to recruit a staggering 419,000 patients in a very short period of time, and follow up on them only with telemedicine.\n“It’s a lovely demonstration of how we can enroll patients completely virtually, which I think is a huge extension for us in terms of patient engagement and enrollment,” Safirstein said.\nDr. Mintu Turakhia, one of the Stanford University researchers who designed and conducted the study with Apple, said this was one of the major points of the study: not to reach an immediate conclusion on the Apple Watch — even there, follow-up data on exactly how patients were treated will be needed — but to learn how to use wearable devices in medical research. “We’ve enrolled 400,000 people in just over eight months,” Turakhia said. He hopes that what they learned will allow them to do more ambitious studies in the future.\n“I don’t think any of us view this study as the end in terms of using apps and devices to monitor cardiac performance or any number of other things,” said Dr. Lloyd Minor, dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine. (He owns a small amount of Apple stock.) “But we think it’s an exciting beginning.”\nConsumer-facing technologies, Minor argued, could change medicine just as they have changed every other aspect of our lives. But that still doesn’t tell you whether it’s a good idea to buy an Apple Watch."}

The company was looking for owners of its smartwatch to participate in the Apple Heart Study—a Stanford-led investigation into the wearable's ability to sense irregular heart rhythms. Joining was simple: Install an app and wear your watch. If the watch's optical sensors detected an arrhythmia, you might be shipped a dedicated heart monitor—a benchmark to compare against readings from your Apple Watch—to wear for seven days. In true Apple fashion, enrollment and participation were designed to be as user friendly as possible: \"Apple and Stanford Medicine are committed to making it easy for people to participate in medical research,\" the research partners wrote, \"because more data can lead to discoveries that save lives.\" Now, not for the first time, Apple's attention to user experience has been rewarded: According to a paper outlining the study's design in this week's issue of the American Heart Journal, Apple and Stanford have managed to enroll a staggering 419,093 participants. That makes it the largest screening study on atrial fibrillation ever performed. A study of that size is a big deal for researchers. But even if the results (which should be published next year) are positive, Apple will still have much to prove about the public benefits of its popular wearable. First let's talk study size. 400,000 research subjects is huge. By comparison, the Strokestop study—a Swedish investigation into mass arrhythmia screening—has around 25,000 participants. To be fair, the Strokestop study has things going for it that Apple's study doesn't, which we'll get to. But the fact that Apple was able to round up a research population of this size in under a year is impressive. It's also a major selling point of the study's design. Larger sample sizes make for smaller error margins and a greater degree of certainty in one's results, both of which are important when studying the accuracy of a device designed to flag heart problems. Some five million people in the US are affected by atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (collectively known as AF), irregular heart rhythms that significantly increase one's risk of stroke and heart failure. An estimated 700,000 of those people don't even know they have AF. Cardiologists are particularly interested in that second group. If a product like Apple's could detect undiagnosed arrhythmias across large populations and compel flagged users to take appropriate preemptive action? It could save lives. But here's the thing: Even if the Apple Watch excels at detecting undiagnosed AF (a big if), using it to screen large numbers of asymptomatic people isn't necessarily a good idea. Screening comes with risks: Misdiagnosis. Unnecessary tests. Overtreatment. \"Those are real problems that need to be sorted out,\" says cardiologist Mintu Turakhia, the study's lead author and director of Stanford's Center for Digital Health. That's why he and his team will also observe what happens after Apple Watch users receive an alert: Whether they follow up with a healthcare provider, whether a diagnosis is made, and what treatment they receive. \"We're interested in the patient journey, but we also want to see whether an alert from the watch helps lead to appropriate care,\" Turakhia says. The biggest unknown surrounding AF screening is a simple one: Do its benefits outweigh its costs? \"The current evidence is insufficient to say one way or the other,\" says Seth Landefeld, chair of the department of medicine at University of Alabama Birmingham and a member of the US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent, volunteer panel of national experts in disease prevention. That lack of evidence is why the USPSTF recommends against screening asymptomatic adults. Apple's study doesn't directly address USPSTF's biggest concern. \"The million-dollar question, the one we really need to have answered, is whether people who screen for arrhythmias have fewer strokes, long-term, than those who don't,\" Landefeld says. The present study is designed primarily to see how Apple’s AF detection compares with a dedicated heart monitor—not how the people who receive AF alerts fare in the long haul. For that, you need repeated observations of your participants over a long period of time (a major advantage of the Strokestop study). Randomized control groups wouldn't hurt, either. Turakhia doesn't disagree. But he notes that the thinking on AF has expanded"}

That’s your cue to connect with your doctor or get a more thorough checkup to head off any potentially serious problems down the road.\nIn the NEJM study, the scientists reported results from nearly 420,000 people who already owned Apple Watches and volunteered to participate. Over a period of nearly four days, the watch notified 0.5% of this group of potential abnormal heart rhythms. These people were then asked to contact the study team, which sent them ECG patches to wear on their chest for up to seven days while still using the app. Because AFib is episodic, and doesn’t occur continuously, this allowed the researchers to compare when the app detected abnormal heart rhythms and when the gold-standard ECG did. They matched up 84% of the time.\n“That says that the deployment of the technology was safe and could indeed accurately identify atrial fibrillation,” says Dr. Mintu Turakhia, director of the Stanford University Center for Digital Health and senior author on the url. That means people using the app could, in theory, be alerted to the fact that they have AFib before they have any symptoms.\nTurakhia notes that the study doesn’t necessarily suggest that the Apple app could be used to definitively screen everyone for AFib — yet. But it showed that in a group of people with varying degrees of vulnerability to AFib, an algorithm used in a smartphone-based device could, relatively accurately, pick up the condition. With further confirmation, the app could help identify AFib in people who are not even aware of their condition. ”These are people who may stand to benefit from knowing their condition,” he says, since they could then take preventive measures or get treatment to stability their abnormal heart rate."}

{"prediction": "ASL is one of the most widely used sign languages, consisting of distinct hand gestures that represent letters, words, and phrases. However, existing ASL recognition systems often struggle with real-time performance, accuracy, and robustness across diverse environments. To address these limitations, this study introduces a real-time ASL interpretation system that integrates deep learning with keypoint tracking. By leveraging YOLOv11 for rapid hand gesture recognition and MediaPipe for precise landmark detection, the proposed approach enhances the efficiency and reliability of ASL interpretation. At the core of our system, a built-in webcam functions as a non-contact optical sensor that captures real-time visual data. This vision-based sensor converts light into digital image frames, which serve as the primary input for gesture analysis. MediaPipe extracts 21 keypoints per hand from each frame to generate a skeletal representation, while YOLOv11 detects and classifies specific ASL alphabet letters based on these visual inputs. The webcam’s role as a sensing device enables the system to acquire gesture-based data continuously and reliably. It also ensures that the entire recognition pipeline—from sensing to classification—can operate in real time, even under different lighting conditions and backgrounds, using only standard hardware. This highlights the system’s practical viability as an accessible and scalable assistive technology.

{"prediction": "A team of researchers at Stanford University have created a new method to edit a target portrait footage by taking a sequence of audio as input to synthesize a photorealistic video. This method is unique because it is highly dynamic. It does not assume a person-specific rendering network yet capable of translating arbitrary source audio into arbitrary video output. Instead of learning a highly heterogeneous and nonlinear mapping from audio to the video directly, we first factorize each target video frame into orthogonal parameter spaces, i.e., expression, geometry, and pose, via monocular 3D face reconstruction. Next, a recurrent network is introduced to translate source audio into expression parameters that are primarily related to the audio content. The audio-translated expression parameters are then used to synthesize a photo-realistic human subject in each video frame, with the movement of the mouth regions precisely mapped to the source audio. The geometry and pose parameters of the target human portrait are re- tained, therefore preserving the context of the original video footage. Finally, a novel video rendering network and a dynamic programming method to construct a temporally coherent and photo-realistic video. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches. Our method is end-to-end learnable and robust to voice variations in the source audio.", "reference": "Videos by VICE\nIn this url, at least, the researchers seem to be aware of the risks highly customizable and realistic deepfakes pose to society."}

{"prediction": "OpenAI’s Wav2Vec 2.0 is the latest in a long line of AI-powered speech-to-speech translation models. The model is trained on a large dataset of unlabeled speech and has been fine-tuned on standard benchmarks, especially in a low-data setting. However, because it is purely unsupervised, it lacks an equivalently performant decoder mapping those representations to usable outputs, necessitating a fine-tuning stage in order to actually perform a task such as speech recognition1. This unfortunately limits their usefulness and impact as fine-tuning can still be a complex process requiring a skilled practitioner. In a particularly disturbing example, Radford et al. (2021) documented a 9.2% increase in object classification accuracy when fine-tuning a computer vision model on the ImageNet dataset (Russakovsky et al., 2015) without observing any improvement in average accuracy when classifying the same objects on seven other natural image datasets. A model that achieves “superhuman” performance when trained on a dataset can still make many basic errors when evaluated on another, possibly precisely because it is exploiting those dataset-specific quirks that humans are oblivious to (Geirhos et al., 2020). The goal of a speech recognition system should be to work reliably “out of the box” in a broad range of environments without requiring supervised fine-tuning of a decoder for every deployment distribution.

In a step toward solving it, OpenAI today open-sourced Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system that the company claims enables “robust” transcription in multiple languages as well as translation from those languages into English.\n\nCountless organizations have developed highly capable speech recognition systems, which sit at the core of software and services from tech giants like Google, Amazon and Meta. But what makes Whisper different, according to OpenAI, is that it was trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and “multitask” data collected from the web, which lead to improved recognition of unique accents, background noise and technical jargon.\n\n“The primary intended users of [the Whisper] models are AI researchers studying robustness, generalization, capabilities, biases and constraints of the current model. However, Whisper is also potentially quite useful as an automatic speech recognition solution for developers, especially for English speech recognition,” OpenAI wrote in the GitHub repo for Whisper, from where several versions of the system can be downloaded. “[The models] show strong ASR results in ~10 languages. They may exhibit additional capabilities … if fine-tuned on certain tasks like voice activity detection, speaker classification or speaker diarization but have not been robustly evaluated in these area.”\n\nWhisper has its limitations, particularly in the area of text prediction. Because the system was trained on a large amount of “noisy” data, OpenAI cautions Whisper might include words in its transcriptions that weren’t actually spoken — possibly because it’s both trying to predict the next word in audio and trying to transcribe the audio itself. Moreover, Whisper doesn’t perform equally well across languages, suffering from a higher error rate when it comes to speakers of languages that aren’t well-represented in the training data.\n\nThat last bit is nothing new to the world of speech recognition, unfortunately. Biases have long plagued even the best systems, with a 2020 Stanford study finding systems from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft made far fewer errors — about 19% — with users who are white than with users who are Black.\n\nDespite this, OpenAI sees Whisper’s transcription capabilities being used to improve existing accessibility tools.\n\n“While Whisper models cannot be used for real-time transcription out of the box, their speed and size suggest that others may be able to build applications on top of them that allow for near-real-time speech recognition and translation,” the company continues on GitHub. “The real value of beneficial applications built on top of Whisper models suggests that the disparate performance of these models may have real economic implications … [W]e hope the technology will be used primarily for beneficial purposes, making automatic speech recognition technology more accessible could enable more actors to build capable surveillance technologies or scale up existing surveillance efforts, as the speed and accuracy allow for affordable automatic transcription and translation of large volumes of audio communication.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

GameGAN ingests screenplay and keyboard actions during training and aims to predict the next frame by conditioning on the action, i.e. a key pressed by the agent. It learns from rollouts of image and action pairs directly without having access to the underlying game logic or engine. This is a challenging problem: different games have different number of components as well as different physical dynamics. Furthermore, many games require long-term consistency in the environment. For example, imagine a game where an agent navigates through a maze. When the agent moves away and later returns to a location, it expects the scene to look consistent with what it has encountered before. In visual SLAM, detecting loop closure (returning to a previous location) is already known to be challenging, let alone generating one.

{"prediction": "Google has announced Imagen, a text-to-image diffusion model with an unprecedented degree of photorealism and a deep level of language understanding. Imagen builds on the power of large transformer language models in understanding text and hinges on the strength of diffusion models in high-fidelity image generation. Our key discovery is that generic large language models (e.g. T5), pretrained on text-only corpora, are surprisingly effective at encoding text for image synthesis: increasing the size of the language model in Imagen boosts both sample fidelity and imagetext alignment much more than increasing the size of the image diffusion model. Imagen achieves a new state-of-the-art FID score of 7.27 on the COCO dataset, without ever training on COCO, and human raters find Imagen samples to be on par with the COCO data itself in image-text alignment. To assess text-to-image models in greater depth, we introduce DrawBench, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for text-to-image models. With DrawBench, we compare text-to-image models in greater depth, both in terms of sample quality and image-text alignment.", "reference": "As for Chirp, it’s a speech model trained on “millions” of hours of audio that supports more than 100 languages and can be used to caption videos, offer voice assistance and generally power a range of speech tasks and apps."}

{"prediction": "AlphaFold 3 (AF3) is a model that is capable of high-accuracy prediction of complexes containing nearly all molecular types present in the Protein Data Bank32 (PDB). In all but one category, it achieves a substantially higher performance than strong methods that specialize just the given task (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Table 1), including higher accuracy at protein structure and the structure of protein–protein interactions. This is achieved by a substantial evolution of the AF2 architecture and training procedure both to accommodate more general chemical structures and to improve the data efficiency of learning. The system reduces the amount of multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) processing by replacing the AF2 evoformer with the simpler pairformer module (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, it directly predicts the raw atom coordinates with a diffusion module, replacing the AF2 structure module that operated on amino-acid-specific frames and side-chain torsion angles (Fig. 2b). The multiscale nature of the diffusion process (low noise levels induce the network to improve local structure) also enable us to eliminate stereochemical losses and most special handling of bonding patterns in the network, easily accommodating arbitrary chemical components.", "reference": "A technology cluster in Cambridge, Massachusetts, gives researchers from various sectors somewhere to collaborate easily.Credit: Brooks Kraft LLC/Corbis/Getty The latest iteration of the protein-structure-prediction algorithm AlphaFold has generated a great deal of interest since its release, accompanied by a url in Nature, earlier this month1.

The artificial intelligence tool will be important in both fundamental research and drug discovery. But its release has also prompted questions, and criticism, of both the AlphaFold team at Google DeepMind in London and Nature. When AlphaFold2 was published2, the full underlying code was made accessible to all researchers. But AlphaFold3 comes with ‘pseudocode’ — a detailed description of what the code can do and how it works. Major AlphaFold upgrade offers boost for drug discovery This was not a decision we took lightly, and this editorial briefly explains our reasoning. We think that research, regardless of the sector that does it, should be evaluated through peer review and published for the benefit of society and science. At the same time, we have no wish for this to be the final word. This is an opportunity for an important conversation among all research stakeholders at a time when the majority of global research is privately funded. The basics of how the community can use the new version of AlphaFold remain the same: anyone with a Google account can use the tool for free, for non-commercial applications. But there are important differences between the latest iteration and previous ones. Notably, for AlphaFold2, the DeepMind team worked with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute, an intergovernmental (and publicly funded) research organization based in Cambridge, UK. DeepMind researchers have trained their software on thousands of published records of protein structures and their known shapes. Now, DeepMind has partnered with Isomorphic Labs, a London-based drug-development company owned by Google’s parent, Alphabet. In addition to the non-availability of the full code, there are other restrictions on the use of the tool — for example, in drug development. There are also daily limits on the numbers of predictions that individual researchers can perform. Many researchers are disappointed by these constraints. In an open letter to Nature (see go.nature.com/3k9acav), its authors point out that the lack of an open-source code limits verification and reproducibility efforts. The letter has had an impact. Shortly after it was published, DeepMind’s vice-president of research, Pushmeet Kohli, posted on the social-media platform X that the team is “working on releasing the AF3 model (incl weights) for academic use” within six months. This is an important step, and Nature will update the published url once the code is released. AI’s potential to accelerate drug discovery needs a reality check But why allow the complete data and code to be restricted at the time of publication? Nature’s editorial policies have been developed to support open science and state: “Authors are required to make materials, data, code, and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications.” One way we enable researchers to do so is through a partnership with Code Ocean, a computational-science platform that makes the information reproducible and traceable. But our policies also acknowledge that there can be restrictions, which “must be disclosed to the editors at the time of submission” and agreed with editors. The policy also states: “Any reason that would preclude the need for code or algorithm sharing will be evaluated by the editors who reserve the right to decline the url if important code is unavailable.” Reasons for restrictions include a lack of discipline-wide data-reporting standards or of the technological infrastructure necessary for depositing data openly and in structured repositories. In other cases, confidentiality might have to be protected, or data might be withheld for safety, security or legal reasons. Similar principles apply to the availability of code, which is why Nature’s policies include an option for releasing the training model and pseudocode or limited code, as attested by examples of studies we have published in chemistry3, climate change4 and virology5. The private sector funds most global research and development, and many of the results of such work are not published in peer-reviewed journals. We at Nature think it’s important that journals engage with the private sector and work with its scientists so they can submit their research for peer review and publication. This promotes the sharing of knowledge,"}
{"prediction": "A team of researchers at Stanford University have developed a new algorithm that can predict the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. The algorithm, known as AF3, is trained on a large dataset of amino acid sequences and is able to predict the structure of a protein from amino acid sequences that it has previously been trained on. AF3’s architecture is similar to that of AF2, with a large trunk evolving a pairwise representation of the chemical complex followed by a structure module that uses the pairwise representation to generate explicit atomic positions, but there are large differences in each major component. These modifications were driven both by the need to accommodate a wide range of chemical entities without excessive special casing and by observations of AF2 performance with different modifications. Within the trunk, MSA processing is substantially de-emphasized, with a much smaller and simpler MSA embedding block (Supplementary Methods 3.3). Compared with the original evoformer from AF2, the number of blocks (48) is reduced to four, the processing of the MSA representation uses an inexpensive pair-weighted averaging and only the pair representation is used for later processing steps. The ‘pairformer’ (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Methods 3.6) replaces the evoformer of AF2, as the dominant processing block. It operates only on the pair representation and the single representation; the MSA representation is not retained and all information passes through the pair representation. The diffusion module (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Methods 3.7) operates directly on raw atom coordinates, and on a coarse abstract token representation, without rotation", "reference": "Many researchers are disappointed by these constraints.

Demonstrating this promise, Google researchers have worked with doctors to develop an AI that can automatically identify diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause blindness among adults. Using deep learning—the same breed of AI that identifies faces, animals, and objects in pictures uploaded to Google's online services—the system detects the condition by examining retinal photos. In a recent study, it succeeded at about the same rate as human opthamologists, according to a paper published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \"We were able to take something core to Google---classifying cats and dogs and faces---and apply it to another sort of problem,\" says Lily Peng, the physician and biomedical engineer who oversees the project at Google. But the idea behind this AI isn't to replace doctors. Blindness is often preventable if diabetic retinopathy is caught early. The hope is that the technology can screen far more people for the condition than doctors could on their own, particularly in countries where healthcare is limited, says Peng. The project began, she says, when a Google researcher realized that doctors in his native India were struggling to screen all the locals that needed to be screened.

At least three doctors reviewed each photo, before Peng and team fed about 128,000 of these images into their neural network.

It can identify faces, recognize spoken words, and pull answers to your questions from the web. But the promise is that this same kind of technology will soon handle far more serious work than playing games and feeding smartphone apps. One day, it could help care for the human body. Demonstrating this promise, Google researchers have worked with doctors to develop an AI that can automatically identify diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause blindness among adults. Using deep learning—the same breed of AI that identifies faces, animals, and objects in pictures uploaded to Google's online services—the system detects the condition by examining retinal photos. In a recent study, it succeeded at about the same rate as human opthamologists, according to a paper published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \"We were able to take something core to Google---classifying cats and dogs and faces---and apply it to another sort of problem,\" says Lily Peng, the physician and biomedical engineer who oversees the project at Google. But the idea behind this AI isn't to replace doctors. Blindness is often preventable if diabetic retinopathy is caught early. The hope is that the technology can screen far more people for the condition than doctors could on their own, particularly in countries where healthcare is limited, says Peng. The project began, she says, when a Google researcher realized that doctors in his native India were struggling to screen all the locals that needed to be screened. In many places, doctors are already using photos to diagnose the condition without seeing patients in person. \"This is a well validated technology that can bring screening services to remote locations where diabetic retinal eye screening is less available,\" says David McColloch, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington who specializes in diabetes. That could provide a convenient on-ramp for an AI that automates the process. Peng's project is part of a much wider effort to detect disease and illness using deep neural networks, pattern recognition systems that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Researchers at DeepMind, a Google AI lab in London, have teamed with Britain's National Health Service to build various technologies that can automatically detect when patients are at risk of disease and illness, and several other companies, including Salesforce.com and a startup called Enlitic, are exploring similar systems. At Kaggle, an internet site where data scientists compete to solve real-world problems using algorithms, groups have worked to build their own machine learning systems that can automatically identify diabetic retinopathy. Medical Brains Peng is part of Google Brain, a team inside the company that provides AI software and services for everything from search to security to Android. Within this team, she now leads a group spanning dozens of researchers that focuses solely on medical applications for AI. The work on diabetic retinopathy started as a \"20 Percent project\" about two years ago, before becoming a full-time effort. Researchers began working with hospitals in the Indian cities of Aravind and Sankara that were already collecting retinal photos for doctors to examine. Then the Google team asked more than four dozen doctors in India and the US to identify photos where mini-aneurysms, hemorrhages, and other issues indicated that diabetic patients could be at risk for blindness. At least three doctors reviewed each photo, before Peng and team fed about 128,000 of these images into their neural network. Ultimately, the system identified the condition slightly more consistently than the original group of doctors. At its most sensitive, the system avoided both false negatives and false positives more than 90 percent of the time, exceeding the National Institutes of Health's recommended standard of at least 80 percent accuracy and precision for diabetic retinopathy screens. Given the success of deep learning algorithms with other machine vision tasks, the results of the original trial aren't surprising. But Yaser Sheikh, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon who is working on other forms of AI for healthcare, says that actually moving this kind of thing into the developing world can be difficult. \"It is the kind of thing that sounds good, but actually making it work has proven to be far more difficult,\" he says. \"Getting technology to actually help in the developing world---there are many, many systematic barriers.\" But Peng and her team are pushing forward. She says Google is now running additional trials with photos taken specifically to train its diagnostic AI. Preliminary results, she says, indicate that the system once again performs as well as trained doctors. The machines, it seems, are gaining new kinds of sight."}

{"prediction": "A group of researchers from the University of California Berkeley have developed a new method for generating video sequences of an object in a source image according to the motion of a driving video. The method is based on generative adversarial networks (CNNs), which are trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies). The method is trained on a set of videos depicting objects of the same category (e.g. faces, human bodies), and can be applied to any object of this class. To achieve this, we decouple appearance and motion information using a self-supervised formulation. To support complex motions, we use a representation consisting of a set of learned keypoints along with their local affine transformations. A generator network models occlusions arising during target motions and combines the appearance extracted from the source image with the motion derived from the driving video. Our method scores best on diverse benchmarks and on a variety of object categories.", "reference": "Image animation consists of generating a video sequence so that an object in a source image is animated according to the motion of a driving video. Our framework addresses this problem without using any annotation or prior information about the specific object to animate.

At test time, the source image is animated according to the corresponding keypoint trajectories estimated in the driving video. The major weakness of Monkey-Net is that it poorly models object appearance transformations in the keypoint neighborhoods assuming a zeroth order model (as we show in Sec. 3.1). This leads to poor generation quality in the case of large object pose changes (see Fig. 4). To tackle this issue, we propose to use a set of self-learned keypoints together with local localization.", "reference": "Seeing used to be believing. Thank AI, we finally have to farewell this cute and naive, but dangerous faith. Because it actually never was. In the XXth century, photos were retouched by repressive regimes. With Deep Learning, we experience new ways to re-illustrate reality. It is not a danger; it's a chance.\nUsing a painting by Arcimboldo, we can see how the motion assignment works — some of the graphical features are still detected as background and are not animated.\nThe most interesting effect happens if we use an image without physiognomical patterns — or even abstract art. I used work by Pollock:\nProbably if we combine this method with StyleTransfer — or even with Deep Painterly Harmonization, we will achieve even more coherent results.\nCan we still believe in visuals? Can we distinguish between real and fake in the Digital Age? The answer is: \"we cannot anymore\". But: the answer still does not end on that point.\nThis naive belief in the truth behind an image — so seductive because so simple — is a dangerous deception. There are zillions of truths behind an image. Even a raw image without any traces of post-production is not a truth, but a particularly chosen perspective. A glimpse of the unknown ontology. Pars pro toto — and we should take care of its semantical fragility.\nWe have to re-think our relationship with concepts of truth. Because there are so many truths like people. Sure, it's easy to deceive somebody, faking an image or video footage and presenting it as a real thing. And people do it already — from friendly pranks till presidential uses.\nBelieving in images is a comfortable self-deception. And I am thankful to all AI efforts to disrupt this belief."}

However, to our knowledge, a randomised trial has not yet been conducted. In this randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, single-blinded, screening accuracy study, women aged 40–80 years eligible for mammography screening (including general screening with 15–2-year intervals and annual screening for those with moderate hereditary risk of breast cancer or a history of breast cancer) at four screening sites in Sweden were informed about the study as part of the screening invitation. Those who did not opt out were randomly allocated (1:1) to AI-supported screening (intervention group) or standard double reading without AI (control group). Screening examinations were automatically randomised by the Picture Archive and Communications System with a pseudo-random number generator after image acquisition. The participants and the radiographers acquiring the screening examinations, but not the radiologists reading the screening examinations were masked to study group allocation. The AI system (Transpara version 1.7.0) provided an examination-based malignancy risk score on a 10-level scale that was used to triage screening examinations to single reading (score 1–9) or double reading (score 10).

But there is a shortage of breast radiologists in many countries, including a shortfall of around 41 (8%) in the UK in 2020 and about 50 in Sweden, and it takes over a decade to train a radiologist capable of interpreting mammograms.\nBetween April 2021 and July 2022, 80,033 women aged 40-80 years who had undergone mammogram screening at four sites in southwest Sweden were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either AI-supported analysis, where a commercially available AI-supported mammogram reading system analyzed the mammograms before they were also read by one or two radiologists (intervention arm), or standard analysis performed by two radiologists without AI (control arm).\nThe system also provided CAD marks to assist radiologists in accurately interpreting mammography images. Women were recalled for additional testing based on suspicious findings. Radiologists had the final decision to recall women and were instructed to recall cases with the highest 1% risk, except for obvious false positives.\nWriting in a urled Comment, Dr. Nereo Segnan, former Head of the Unit of Cancer Epidemiology and past Director of Department of Screening at CPO Piemonte in Italy (who was not involved in the study) notes that the AI risk score for breast cancer seems very accurate at being able to separate high risk from low-risk women, adding that, \"In risk stratified screening protocols, the potential for appropriately modulating the criteria for recall in low-risk and high-risk groups is remarkable.\""}

{"prediction": "We show for the first time that learning powerful representations from speech audio alone followed by fine-tuning on transcribed speech can outperform the best semi-supervised methods while being conceptually simpler. Wav2vec 2.0 masks the speech input in the latent space and solves a contrastive task defined over a quantization of the latent representations which are jointly learned. Experiments using all labeled data of Librispeech achieve 1.8/3.3 WER on the clean/other test sets. When lowering the amount of labeled data to one hour, wav2vec 2.0 outperforms the previous state of the art on the 100 hour subset while using 100 times less labeled data. Using just ten minutes of labeled data and pre-training on 53k hours of unlabeled data still achieves 4.8/8.2 WER. This demonstrates the feasibility of speech recognition with limited amounts of labeled data.", "reference": "This opens the door for speech recognition models in many more languages, dialects, and domains that previously required much more transcribed audio data to provide acceptable accuracy.\nSimilar to the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), our model is trained by predicting speech units for masked parts of the audio. A major difference is that speech audio is a continuous signal that captures many aspects of the recording with no clear segmentation into words or other units. Wav2vec 2.0 tackles this issue by learning basic units that are 25ms long to enable learning of high-level contextualized representations. These units are then used to describe many different speech audio recordings and make wav2vec more robust. This enables us to build speech recognition systems that can outperform the best semisupervised methods, even with 100x less labeled training data.\nLearning discrete latent speech units\nWhat happens if we increase the amount of unannotated data? To answer this question, we trained on 53K hours of unannotated data from the LibriVox dataset (a large collection of public audiobooks) and fine-tuned with only 10 minutes of labeled data. The result was a model that still achieved a WER of 8.6 percent. This demonstrates that wav2vec 2.0 can enable speech recognition models for settings where there is very little labeled training data."}

Our approach encodes speech audio via a multi-layer convolutional neural network and then masks spans of the resulting latent speech representations, similar to masked language modeling [9]. The latent representations are fed to a Transformer network to build contextualized representations and the model is trained via a contrastive task where the true latent is to be distinguished from distractors [54, 49, 48, 28]. As part of training, we learn discrete speech units [53, 32, 7, 18] via a gumbel softmax [24, 5] to represent the latent representations in the contrastive task (Figure 1) which we find to be more effective than non-quantized targets.

Good systems require large amounts of annotated data, which is only available for a small number of languages. Self-supervision provides a way to leverage unannotated data to build better systems.\nOther self-supervised approaches for speech try to reconstruct the audio signal, which requires the model to capture every aspect of the speech, including recording environment, channel noise, and speaker traits. Another common approach is to train the model by asking it to predict what the speaker said next by contrasting several options."}

Self-supervision has helped us advance image classification, video understanding, and our content understanding systems. We hope that the algorithm will enable improved speech technology for many more languages, dialects, and domains, and lead to improvements for existing systems. Our approach learns a set of speech units, which are shorter than phonemes, to describe the speech audio sequence. Since this set is finite, the model cannot represent all variations, such as background noise. Instead, the units encourage the model to focus on the most important factors to represent the speech audio. In our experiments, we find that this works better than alternative approaches on the LibriSpeech benchmark. With cross-lingual training, wav2vec 2.0 learns speech units that are used in multiple languages. With wav2vec 2.0, we can also learn speech units that are used across languages. We find that some units are used for only a particular language, whereas others are used in similar languages and sometimes even in languages that aren’t very similar. Performance on public speech benchmarks We trained wav2vec on 960 hours of unannotated speech data from the LibriSpeech benchmark, which contains public audiobooks. After pretraining, we fine-tuned the model on 100 hours, 1 hour, or just 10 minutes of annotated data from Libri-light to perform speech recognition. The result shows a large improvement over the previous state of the art on 100 hours of annotated data (Noisy Student training) when wav2vec 2.0 uses the same amount of annotated data. Moreover, it still shows improvement over the previous best result even when using 100x less annotated data, or just one hour. WER for Noisy Student self-training with 100 hours of labeled data. Wav2vec 2.0 with 100 hours, 1 hour, and only 10 minutes of labeled data. All models use the remainder of the LibriSpeech corpus (total 960 hours) as unannotated data, except for the last result, which uses 53K hours from LibriVox. To evaluate cross-linguality, we trained wav2vec 2.0 on unannotated speech audio of 12 languages from the Common Voice benchmark. The resulting approach, called XLSR, shows that cross-lingual training dramatically improves performance on low-resource languages, compared with training only on a single language. We also measured how often the learned speech units are used in each language and visualized the result in a 2D plot. This illustration shows that related languages tend to use similar units, which confirms that our model learns cross-lingual units. Wav2vec 2.0 enables us to build better speech recognition systems for many more languages and domains with much less annotated data. We’ve open-sourced the code and pretrained models to enable other researchers to do exactly this. The code is part of fairseq, Facebook AI Research’s sequence modeling toolkit, which provides implementations for many of our research urls. A few commands enable training and fine-tuning of the provided models. We are excited about the potential of powerful speech representations for other applications,"}

However, challenges remain in long-form medical question answering and handling real-world workfows. Here, we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps with a combination of base LLM improvements, medical domain fne-tuning and new strategies for improving reasoning and grounding through ensemble refnement and chain of retrieval. Med-PaLM 2 scores up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM by over 19%, and demonstrates dramatic performance increases across MedMCQA, PubMedQA and MMLU clinical topics datasets. Our detailed human evaluations framework shows that physicians prefer Med-PaLM 2 answers to those from other physicians on eight of nine clinical axes. Med-PaLM 2 also demonstrates signifcant improvements over its predecessor across all evaluation metrics, particularly on new adversarial datasets designed to probe LLM limitations (P 0.001). In a pilot study using real-world medical questions, specialists preferred Med-PaLM 2 answers to generalist physician answers 65% of the time. While specialist answers were still preferred overall, both specialists and generalists rated Med-PaLM 2 to be as safe as physician answers, demonstrating its growing potential in real-world medical applications.

The freely available database represents an enormous advance and convenience for scientists across hundreds of disciplines and domains, and may very well form the foundation of a new phase in biology and medicine. The problem with the proteome is that it’s much, much more complex. Proteins, like DNA, are sequences of known molecules; in DNA these are the handful of familiar bases (adenine, guanine, etc.), but in proteins they are the 20 amino acids (each of which is coded by multiple bases in genes). This in itself creates a great deal more complexity, but it’s only the start. The sequences aren’t simply “code” but actually twist and fold into tiny molecular origami machines that accomplish all kinds of tasks within our body. It’s like going from binary code to a complex language that manifests objects in the real world. Practically speaking this means that the proteome is made up of not just 20,000 sequences of hundreds of acids each, but that each one of those sequences has a physical structure and function. And one of the hardest parts of understanding them is figuring out what shape is made from a given sequence. This is generally done experimentally using something like x-ray crystallography, a long, complex process that may take months or longer to figure out a single protein — if you happen to have the best labs and techniques at your disposal. The structure can also be predicted computationally, though the process has never been good enough to actually rely on — until AlphaFold came along. Without going into the whole history of computational proteomics (as much as I’d like to), we essentially went from distributed brute-force tactics 15 years ago — remember Folding@home? — to more honed processes in the last decade. Then AI-based approaches came on the scene, making a splash in 2019 when DeepMind’s AlphaFold leapfrogged every other system in the world — then made another jump in 2020, achieving accuracy levels high enough and reliable enough that it prompted some experts to declare the problem of turning an arbitrary sequence into a 3D structure solved. I’m only compressing this long history into one paragraph because it was extensively covered at the time, but it’s hard to overstate how sudden and complete this advance was. This was a problem that stumped the best minds in the world for decades, and it went from “we maybe have an approach that kind of works, but extremely slowly and at great cost” to “accurate, reliable, and can be done with off the shelf computers” in the space of a year. The result is that 98.5% of the human proteome is now “folded,” as they say, meaning there is a predicted structure that the AI model is confident enough (and importantly, we are confident enough in its confidence) represents the real thing. Oh, and they also folded the proteome for 20 other organisms, like yeast and E. coli, amounting to about 350,000 protein structures total. It’s by far — by orders of magnitude — the largest and best collection of this absolutely crucial information. Ordinarily examining the proteins suspected of being at the root of a given problem would be expensive and time-consuming, and for diseases that affect relatively few people, money and time are in short supply when they can be applied to more common problems like cancers or dementia-related diseases. But being able to simply call up the structures of 10 healthy proteins and 10 mutated versions of the same, insights may appear in seconds that might otherwise have taken years of painstaking experimental work. The drug discovery and testing process still takes years, but maybe now it can start tomorrow for a currently untreatable disease instead of in 2025. Lest you think too much is resting on a computer’s prediction of experimentally unverified results, in another, totally different case, some of the painstaking work had already been done. John McGeehan of the University of Portsmouth, with whom DeepMind partnered for another potential use case, explained how this affected his team’s work on plastic decomposition. The plan is to, over the next year or two, make predictions for every single known and sequenced protein — somewhere in the neighborhood of a hundred million. And for the most part (the few structures not susceptible to this approach seem to make themselves known quickly) biologists should be able to have great confidence in the results. “This was by far the hardest"}

{"prediction": "A team of researchers at Stanford University have developed a new method for generating high-resolution images using neural networks. The work, known as latent diffusion models, is based on a deep neural network architecture that allows for the simultaneous generation of high-resolution and low-resolution images with the same set of inputs. In the new method, the model is trained on a latent representation of a set of pre-trained autoencoders. The model is trained on a latent representation of a set of pre-trained autoencoders, which allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. According to the researchers, the new method can be used to generate images inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including text-to-image synthesis, unconditional image generation and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. The researchers say the method can be used to generate images inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including text-to-image synthesis, unconditional image generation and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs. The researchers say the method can be used to generate images inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including text-to-image synthesis, unconditional image generation and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.", "reference": "This has been led by Patrick Esser from Runway and Robin Rombach from the Machine Vision & Learning research group at LMU Munich (formerly CompVis lab at Heidelberg University) building on their prior work on Latent Diffusion Models at CVPR’22, combined with support from communities at Eleuther AI, LAION, and our own generative AI team.\nStable Diffusion is a text-to-image model empowering billions of people to create stunning art within seconds.

Our friends at Hugging Face will host the model weights once you get access. The code is available here, and the model card is here. We are working together towards a public release soon. This has been led by Patrick Esser from Runway and Robin Rombach from the Machine Vision & Learning research group at LMU Munich (formerly CompVis lab at Heidelberg University) building on their prior work on Latent Diffusion Models at CVPR’22, combined with support from communities at Eleuther AI, LAION, and our own generative AI team.

Our fndings highlight how, despite some 10 initial successes and the positive opinions of clients, caregivers and speech and language therapists the Look to Speak application 11 largely failed to deliver substantial communication benefts to individual users.

While such technology holds promise for individuals with complex communication difficulties, especially in low resource settings, the research highlights that technology alone is insufficient for successful implementation. The study identifies significant deficits in social, technical, and service infrastructure that impede adoption, potentially outweighing any functional benefits of the technology itself. The research identified critical challenges in the form of a lack of readily available technical support for device maintenance and software updates, coupled with limited access to trained speech and language therapists (SLTs) and caregivers capable of supporting users.

The project adapted an open-source data collection app, incorporating both image and text prompts appropriate for people living with impaired speech. Data collection involved in-person and virtual methods, with speech and language therapist screening of potential participants based on speech severity and cognitive skills. Thirty hours of audio data were collected from people living with cerebral palsy, stammering, and cleft palate. The url discusses the challenges encountered in data collection and transcription of Akan – with its still evolving writing system. The url explores adaptation of the open-source Whisper model by fine-tuning a base Akan model (trained on approximately 100 hours of unimpaired speech in Akan and using the collected impaired speech data. Initial results demonstrate a median relative WER reduction of 21.7% on the impaired speech test set, highlighting the significant performance gap of standard ASR on disordered speech (baseline median WER of 84.6%). The study identifies data quality and transcription inconsistencies as key areas for future improvement. The resulting dataset, cookbook, and open-source tools will be publicly available. How people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis use personalized automatic speech recognition technology to support communication Richard Cave Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also known as Motor Neurone Disease (MND) - is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease causing progressive muscular weakness. Most people living with ALS (plwALS) experience speech change (often referred to as dysarthria), eventually becoming unable to communicate using natural speech. Many wish to use speech for as long as possible. Personalized automated speech recognition (ASR) model technology, such as Google's Project Relate, is argued to better recognize speech with dysarthria, supporting maintenance of understanding through real-time captioning. The objectives of this study are how plwALS and communication partners use Relate in everyday conversation over a period of up to 12 months and how it may change with any decline in speech over time.The study videoed interactions between three plwALS and communication partners. We assessed ASR caption accuracy and how well they preserved meaning. Conversation analysis was used to identify participants' own organizational practices in the accomplishment of interaction. Thematic analysis was used to understand better the participants' experiences of using ASR captions.All plwALS reported lower-than-expected ASR accuracy when used in conversation and felt ASR captioning was useful in certain contexts. All participants liked the concept of live captioning and were hopeful that future improvements to ASR accuracy may support their communication in everyday life. Training is needed on best practices for customization and practical use of ASR technology and for the limitations of ASR in conversational settings. Support is needed for those less confident with technology and to reduce misplaced allocation of ownership of captioning errors, risking negative effects on psychological well-being. url to Full Content Developing African Language Models for Atypical Speech Richard Cave, Catherine Holloway, Gifty Ayoka, Katrin Tomanek, Giulia Barbareschi, Victoria Austin This url outlines the need for and ongoing development of automated speech recognition (ASR) models for people living with impaired speech in African languages and support innovation of apps and tools for functional use in everyday conversation. While English language ASR models exist for interpreting impaired speech, no known work has addressed language models for African languages. The Centre for Digital Language Inclusion (CDLI) was established to address this gap by creating technologies that support individuals with atypical speech in local languages and cultures, starting with ten African languages.The development of ASR for impaired speech in Low Resource Languages (LRLs) faces significant barriers, primarily due to the lack of recorded speech samples. Existing datasets are almost exclusively in American English, with very limited representation of other languages, and even fewer LRLs. English-focused models often exhibit poor accuracy with how English is spoken in Africa. To overcome these challenges, CDLI adopts a community-led, user-centric research practice, involving partnering with local institutions to collect recordings of impaired speech, developing open-source tools for"}

The project adapted an open-source data collection app, incorporating both image and text prompts appropriate for people living with impaired speech.

How people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis use personalized automatic speech recognition technology to support communication Richard Cave Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also known as Motor Neurone Disease (MND) - is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease causing progressive muscular weakness. Most people living with ALS (plwALS) experience speech change (often referred to as dysarthria), eventually becoming unable to communicate using natural speech. Many wish to use speech for as long as possible. Personalized automated speech recognition (ASR) model technology, such as Google's Project Relate, is argued to better recognize speech with dysarthria, supporting maintenance of understanding through real-time captioning. The objectives of this study are how plwALS and communication partners use Relate in everyday conversation over a period of up to 12 months and how it may change with any decline in speech over time.The study videoed interactions between three plwALS and communication partners. We assessed ASR caption accuracy and how well they preserved meaning. Conversation analysis was used to identify participants' own organizational practices in the accomplishment of interaction. Thematic analysis was used to understand better the participants' experiences of using ASR captions.All plwALS reported lower-than-expected ASR accuracy when used in conversation and felt ASR captioning was useful in certain contexts. All participants liked the concept of live captioning and were hopeful that future improvements to ASR accuracy may support their communication in everyday life. Training is needed on best practices for customization and practical use of ASR technology and for the limitations of ASR in conversational settings.

How people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis use personalized automatic speech recognition technology to support communication Richard Cave Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - also known as Motor Neurone Disease (MND) - is a progressive, ultimately fatal disease causing progressive muscular weakness. Most people living with ALS (plwALS) experience speech change (often referred to as dysarthria), eventually becoming unable to communicate using natural speech. Many wish to use speech for as long as possible. Personalized automated speech recognition (ASR) model technology, such as Google's Project Relate, is argued to better recognize speech with dysarthria, supporting maintenance of understanding through real-time captioning. The objectives of this study are how plwALS and communication partners use Relate in everyday conversation over a period of up to 12 months and how it may change with any decline in speech over time.The study videoed interactions between three plwALS and communication partners. We assessed ASR caption accuracy and how well they preserved meaning. Conversation analysis was used to identify participants' own organizational practices in the accomplishment of interaction. Thematic analysis was used to understand better the participants' experiences of using ASR captions.All plwALS reported lower-than-expected ASR accuracy when used in conversation and felt ASR captioning was useful in certain contexts. All participants liked the concept of live captioning and were hopeful that future improvements to ASR accuracy may support their communication in everyday life. Training is needed on best practices for customization and practical use of ASR technology and for the limitations of ASR in conversational settings. Support is needed for those less confident with technology and to reduce misplaced allocation of ownership of captioning errors, risking negative effects on psychological well-being. url to Full Content Developing African Language Models for Atypical Speech Richard Cave, Catherine Holloway, Gifty Ayoka, Katrin Tomanek, Giulia Barbareschi, Victoria Austin This url outlines the need for and ongoing development of automated speech recognition (ASR) models for people living with impaired speech in African languages and support innovation of apps and tools for functional use in everyday conversation.

{"prediction": "In this work, we investigate the problem of lip-syncing a talking face video of an arbitrary identity to match a target speech segment. Current works excel at producing accurate lip movements on a static image or videos of specific people seen during the training phase. However, they fail to accurately morph the lip movements of arbitrary identities in dynamic, unconstrained talking face videos, resulting in significant parts of the video being out-of-sync with the new audio. We identify key reasons pertaining to this and hence resolve them by learning from a powerful lip-sync discriminator. Next, we propose new, rigorous evaluation benchmarks and metrics to accurately measure lip synchronization in unconstrained videos. Extensive quantitative evaluations on our challenging benchmarks show that the lip-sync accuracy of the videos generated by our Wav2Lip model is almost as good as real synced videos. We provide a demo video clearly showing the substantial impact of our Wav2Lip model and evaluation benchmarks on our website: cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/a-lip-sync-expertis-all-you-need-for-speech-to-lip-generation-in-the-wild.

{"prediction": "A crucial aspect of translating such talking face videos or creating new ones is correcting the lip sync to match the desired target speech. Consequently, lip-syncing talking face videos to match a given input audio stream has received considerable attention [6, 13, 17, 18, 23] in the research community. Initial works [19, 22] using deep learning in this space learned a mapping from speech representations to lip landmarks using several hours of a single speaker. More recent works [13, 23] in this line directly generate images from speech representations and show exceptional generation quality for specific speakers which they have been trained upon. Numerous practical applications, however, require models that can readily work for generic identities and speech inputs. This has led to the creation of speaker-independent speech to lip generation models [17, 18] that are trained on thousands of identities and voices. They can generate accurate lip motion on a single, static image of any identity in any voice, including that of a synthetic speech generated by a text-to-speech system [18]. However, to be used for applications like translating a lecture/TV series, for example, these models need to be able to morph the broad diversity of lip shapes present in these dynamic, unconstrained videos as well, and not just on static images. Our work builds upon this latter class of speaker-independent works that aspire to lip-sync talking face videos of any identity and voice. We find that these models that work well for static images are unable to accurately morph the large variety of lip shapes in unconstrained video content, leading to significant portions of the generated video being out-of-sync with the", "reference": "3.

For comparison, the expert discriminator that we will use in this work is 91% accurate on the same test set. We hypothesize two major reasons for this difference. Firstly, LipGAN’s lip-sync discriminator uses a single frame to check for lip-sync. In Table 3, we show that a small temporal context is very helpful while detecting lip-sync. Secondly, the generated images during training contain a lot of artifacts due to the large scale and pose variations. We argue that training the discriminator in a GAN setup on these noisy generated images, as done in LipGAN, results in the discriminator focusing on the visual artifacts instead of the audio-lip correspondence. This leads to a large drop in off-sync detection accuracy (Table 3). We argue and show that the “real”, accurate concept of lip-sync captured from the actual video frames can be used to accurately discriminate and enforce lip-sync in the generated images.", "reference": "The exported OpenVINOTM model will be saved in the checkpoints folder.\n--face_detection_path: path of face detection OpenVINOTMIR"}

{"prediction": "The current evaluation framework for speaker-independent lip-syncing judges the models differently from how it is used while lip-syncing a real video. Specifically, instead of feeding the current frame as a reference (as described in the previous paragraph), a random frame in the video is chosen as the reference to not leak the correct lip information during evaluation. We strongly argue that the evaluation framework in the previous paragraph is not ideal for evaluating the lip-sync quality and accuracy. Upon a closer examination of the above-mentioned evaluation system, we observed a few key limitations, which we discuss below. 4.1.1 Does not reflect the real-world usage. As discussed before, during generation at test time, the model must not change the pose, as the generated face needs to be seamlessly pasted into the frame. However, the current evaluation framework feeds random reference frames in the input, thus demanding the network to change the pose. Thus, the above system does not evaluate how the model would be used in the real world. 4.1.2 Inconsistent evaluation. As the reference frames are chosen at random, this means the test data is not consistent across different works. This would lead to an unfair comparison and hinder the reproducibility of results. 4.1.3 Does not support checking for temporal consistency. As the reference frames are randomly chosen at each time-step, temporal consistency is already lost as the frames are generated at random poses and scales. The current framework cannot support a new metric or a future method that aims to study the temporal consistency aspect of this problem.", "reference": "2. Setup Environment\n4.

{"prediction": "In the recent years, speech-based interaction with computers made significant progress. Digital voice assistants are now ubiquitous due to their integration into many commodity devices such as smartphone, tvs, cars, etc. Even companies use more and more machine learning techniques to drive service bots that interact with their customers. These virtual agents aim for a user-friendly man-machine interface while keeping maintenance costs low. However, a significant challenge is to appeal to humans by delivering information through a medium that is most comfortable to them. While speech-based interaction is already very successful, such as shown in virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google, etc., the visual counterpart is largely missing. This comes to no surprise given that a user would also like to associate the visuals of a face with the generated audio, similar to the ideas behind video conferencing. In fact, the level of engagement for audio-visual interactions is higher than for purely audio ones [10,28].

At run time, we track facial expressions of both source and target video using a dense photometric consistency measure. Reenactment is then achieved by fast and efficient deformation transfer between source and target.

Finally, we convincingly re-render the synthesized target face on top of the corresponding video stream such that it seamlessly blends with the real-world illumination.", "reference": "The short version: take a YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W.
