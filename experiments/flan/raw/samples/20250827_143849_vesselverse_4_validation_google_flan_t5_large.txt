In the first experiment, only annotations from models were used. In the second experiment, only anatomical correctness, completeness, and clinical validity were evaluated. The first experiment was conducted in a blinded manner. The evaluators were asked to rate the annotations. The neurologist and neurosurgery resident were asked to evaluate the annotations in a separate blinded fashion. The surgeons were asked to assess the annotations for clinical validity. The radiologist and neuropathic surgeon were asked to judge the annotations based on their impression of the overall quality of the annotations and their impression of clinical validity.
