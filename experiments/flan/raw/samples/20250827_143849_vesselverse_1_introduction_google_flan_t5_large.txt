The medical imaging community has made advancements in acquiring and curating large datasets of brain vessels. Fully annotated data remain scarce, particularly for complex anatomical structures such as the brainâ€™s vasculature. Accurately delineating individual vessels, especially smaller ones, requires significant expertise and meticulous attention to detail. In addition to the tedious nature of the annotation, anonymized Author et al. 2 also found that the 3D cerebral vasculaceous structure is highly branched and multi-scale representation. Accuracyly delineated individual vessels, particularly smaller ones, require significant expertise and diligent attention to detail, and the complexity of the 3D vasculiceous structure makes annotation challenging and time-consuming.
