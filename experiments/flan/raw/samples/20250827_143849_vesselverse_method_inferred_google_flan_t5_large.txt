VesselVerse is a dataset and collaborative framework for brain vessel annotation. It is a collection of publicly available datasets from various neurovascular imaging studies. The datasets are based on the VesselVersion annotation system, which is a crowdsourcing platform that allows users to contribute to the annotation process. The annotation process is facilitated by a collaborative annotation workflow that tracks individual contributions, enables expert reviews, and provides consensus mechanisms for harmonizing different annotation styles and resolving discrepancies that arise from subjective interpretations of vessel boundaries. The annotation workflow is based on a version control system that tracks individual contributors, enables experts to review each other, and provides a consensus mechanism for harmonization of different annotation styles.
