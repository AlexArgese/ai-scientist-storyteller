VesselVerse is a dataset and collaborative framework for brain vessel annotation. It is a multi-expert annotation framework that allows for multiple annotations per image to accommodate diverse annotation styles. The dataset is available in three public datasets and various imaging modalities. The dataset includes 1,130 images across three public dataset, including three publicly available datasets. The dataset contains both veins and arteries. The current release utilizes a single label despite the dataset containing both veins. VesselVerses dynamic formulation enables future updates, allowing for multi-label annotations through community collaboration. Thus, we believe VesselVersed represents a step towards addressing the constant need for data annotation.
