Abstract. This paper is not about a novel method. Instead, it intro-
duces VesselVerse, a large-scale annotation dataset and collaborative
framework for brain vessel annotation. It addresses the critical challenge
of data annotation availability in supervised learning segmentation and
provides a valuable resource for the community. VesselVerse represents
the largest public release of brain vessel annotations to date, compris-
ing 1,130 annotated images from three public datasets across multiple
neurovascular imaging modalities. Its design allows for multi-expert an-
notations per image, accounting for variations across diverse annotation
protocols. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the inclusion of new
annotations and refinements to existing ones, making the dataset dy-
namic. To enhance annotation reliability, VesselVerse integrates tools
for consensus generation and version control mechanisms, enabling the
reversion of errors introduced during annotation refinement. We demon-
strate VesselVerse’s usability by assessing inter-rater agreement among
four expert evaluators.

1 Introduction
Image annotations are essential for developing medical image segmentation algo-
rithms. They are critical in training supervised learning models, which typically
require a substantial amount of paired image data and segmentation masks. Fur-
thermore, even with the increasing use of semi-supervised, weakly supervised, or
unsupervised methods, annotations are still needed for validating and evaluating
the techniques that have been developed. Although the medical imaging com-
munity has made advancements in acquiring and curating large datasets (e.g.,
[18]), fully annotated data remain scarce, particularly for complex anatomical
structures such as the brain’s vasculature.
The scarcity of large, annotated datasets of brain vessels can be attributed
to the intricate and complex nature of the 3D cerebral vasculature. Its highly
branched structure, multi-scale representation, and often tortuous paths make
manual annotation challenging and time-consuming. Accurately delineating in-
dividual vessels, especially smaller ones, requires significant expertise and metic-
ulous attention to detail. In addition to the tedious nature of the annotation
process, differences in annotation protocols and the subjective interpretation of
these protocols further complicate matters. Variations in how vessels are defined,
the level of detail required, and the specific tools used can lead to discrepancies
in vessel annotation [16], thus introducing inter-rater variability [9]. As a result,
comprehensive annotated datasets of the brain vessels are limited, often employ
differing annotation protocols (see Table 1) and exhibit significant variations in
the resulting annotations (Figure 1).
Crowdsourcing provides a promising solution for annotating large neurovas-
cular imaging datasets while reducing annotator fatigue and errors by sharing
the workload among experts. However, recent studies have raised concerns about
the annotation quality achieved through crowdsourcing platforms [17]. To fully
benefit from crowdsourcing, the complex task of vessel annotation requires qual-
ity control mechanisms in place. These should include version control systems
for tracking individual contributions, facilitating expert reviews, and consensus
mechanisms for harmonizing different annotation styles and resolving discrepan-
cies that arise from subjective interpretations of vessel boundaries.
Although version control systems are widely adopted in software develop-
ment, their usage and integration into medical imaging annotated datasets re-
main limited. Open-access datasets propose final segmentation masks without
tracking the evolution of annotations, and very few previous efforts offer mecha-
nismstointegratemultipleexpertannotationsandrefinements[20].Open-source
tools like ITK-Snap [24] or 3D Slicer [10] provide advanced visualization and
analysis but lack built-in version-controlled annotation workflows.
To address these limitations, we introduce VesselVerse, the largest release
of brain vessel annotations to date, comprising three publicly available datasets
totaling 1,130 annotated images from various neurovascular imaging modalities.
VesselVerse also features a novel framework that systematically tracks anno-
tation evolution, allows for multiple expert annotations and refinement, and
integrates these through consensus generation. The VesselVerse dataset and
framework can be accessed at VesselVerseDataset and VesselVerseFramework1

Neurovascular Imaging Databases. Large neurovascular imaging datasets
like the UK Biobank (over 50,000 images) and OASIS-3 (about 3,000 images)
lack annotations. Annotated datasets are much fewer (Table 1), and their dif-
fering annotation styles challenge their joint use for model training, something
COSTA [12] has addressed partially. VesselVerse offers the largest collection
of annotations, with multiple masks that enable users to select from different
annotation protocols or create a consensus.
